# Github-Follow-Bot
# Follow people on Github to get more followers


* Follows people from the most followed on github, thus more likely to follow.
* Depending on internet connection, script will run over 24-48 hours.

**Considered spammy so use at your own risk

### Requirements

* Selenium Python Webdriver, if the latest Firefox version is on your computer or device, the Webdriver may not work. Sometimes this occurs with just 1 version number.

### Misc

Make sure you are careful when using this, good way to inflate your follower base (without legitamelty building something awesome) it will be apparent that you are being spammy. After following 170k people I got an email from github to knock it off. I then rewrote this to simply click all "unfollow" buttons (rather easy).

Good luck, and may this help you out in your "fake it until you make it shemes." (:
